# Assignment to Self in Assignment Operator
In the code, the assignment operator for the Dog class includes a check for assignment to self, which is an important step to handle a situation 
where an object is assigned to itself. This is done by comparing the addresses of the objects involved in the assignment operation.

The assignment to self check is crucial to prevent unnecessary operations and potential issues. 
In this case, without the check, the assignment operator would attempt to delete the existing Collar object and allocate a new one, 
even though the source and destination objects are the same. This would lead to undefined behavior and likely crash the program.

# try-catch block
The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code within the try block. By using try-catch, we can catch exceptions and take appropriate action, such as displaying an error message or gracefully exiting the program, instead of allowing the program to crash due to an unhandled exception.

In the SmartDog assignment operator, the try-catch block is used to handle potential memory allocation issues.
If the try-catch block was not present, and memory allocation failed, the thrown exception would not be caught, resulting in the program crashing due to the unhandled exception. This would lead to an undesirable user experience and potential loss of data.
