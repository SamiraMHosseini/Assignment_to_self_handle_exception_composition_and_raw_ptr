# Assignment to Self in Assignment Operator
In the code, the assignment operator for the Dog class includes a check for assignment to self, which is an important step to handle a situation 
where an object is assigned to itself. This is done by comparing the addresses of the objects involved in the assignment operation.

The assignment to self check is crucial to prevent unnecessary operations and potential issues. 
In this case, without the check, the assignment operator would attempt to delete the existing Collar object and allocate a new one, 
even though the source and destination objects are the same. This would lead to undefined behavior and likely crash the program.
